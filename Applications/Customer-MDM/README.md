## Overview 
![Katana](img/katanalogo.png "Katana")  

We've been hired by a fictitious auto manufacturing company called "Katana" to build a customer MDM application prototype.  Katana has a global market place consisting of automobile dealerships, online websites, and financial services for its customers of its two major brands. __"Katana"__ motors sells quality family vehicles, and its high end luxury brand __"Legacy"__ sells high performance extreemly high end luxury vehicles.  Each brand has its own set of dealerships and systems that repersent the customer in a variety of different ways.  Katana may have the same customer or the same customer household buying both brands and is unaware that these two apparently different customers may be the same individual buying cars for the same household.

You have been tasked to create a minimum viable product (MVP), a basic protype, of a customer MDM application across all dealerships and online sites for both Kanakata and Legacy brands. They wish to test both the functionality and performance of the application.  The functionality includes identifying a single customer from all systems and providing customer updates in real time to their third party dealerships and financing division.

Additionally Katana motors has been given the task of removing sensitive customer data from all its related transactional systems. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the Nevada Consumer Privacy Law requires Katana to remove all customer data from its many transactional systems if a customer "opts out" and does not want their identifiable data inside Katana.  The intent to change all the systems to identify the customer through a unique token generated in the Customer MDM and use only the token in all the related transactional systems.  When a transactional system needs to display customer information it will request that information via a rest based API to the Customer MDM application.  Should the customer opt out of Katana then only one system, the customer MDM, will need to remove the customer identifiable data.

The desire is to have a serverless REST based API layer to service the myriad of transactional systems that will not require any maintenance, and can scale automatically as demand increases with out human intervention.

Customer data will be loaded into the Customer MDM as new customers come into the website and sign up for promotional offerings.  Customer data will also come into the Customer MDM with nightly batch loads from Katana financial services for the previous days loan applications.  The two different dealerships also load prospective customers and customer purchase data when a vehicle is taken for a test drive or purchased.  All of these websites and dealerships have a variety of data formats.

Our job is to ingest data from all these sources and both preserve a record of the data as it exists in each of these systems as well as a master copy that reconciles the customer into a single view and golden source of truth across all of the systems.
