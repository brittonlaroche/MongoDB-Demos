The MongoDB Stitch serverless platform makes it easy to build modern, cross-platform applications on top of MongoDB. Stitch removes the need for tedious boilerplate and automatically manages your app’s backend so you can focus on building what matters.

Read below for an overview, and then lets get started. Within 30 minutes you should have completed your first stitch application. What Does Stitch Provide? At a high level Stitch provides the following features:

### Stitch QueryAnywhere

Exposes the full power of working with documents in MongoDB and the MongoDB query language, directly from your web and mobile application frontend code. A powerful rules engine lets developers declare fine-grained security policies. 
  [QueryAnwhere Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/getting-started/configure-rules-based-access-to-mongodb/)


### Stitch Functions

Allows developers to run simple JavaScript functions in the Stitch serverless platform, making it easy to implement application logic, securely integrate with cloud services and microservices, and build APIs  
  [Stitch Functions Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/functions/)

### Stitch Triggers

Executes functions in real time in response to changes in the database or user authentication events.  
  [Stitch Trigger Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/triggers/)

### Stitch Mobile Sync (Beta)

Automatically synchronizes data between documents held locally in MongoDB Mobile and the backend database.
